# Calculating Time

# What if we have miltiple expression/loops/etc?
1 + 1 + 1
# if you have m.e. that are not in a loop you just add them
# if they are in a loop then we multiply them
n * n * n

# What about O(logn)?
# What about O(nlong)?
It's when you have a linear complexity in a loop, and you divide your dataset by a base(2,4,6,8, etc) in the loop

Complexity	Operation
O(1)	Running a statement
O(1)	Value look-up on an array, object, variable
O(logn)	Loop that cuts problem in half every iteration
O(n)	Looping through the values of an array
O(n^2)	Double nested loops
O(n^3)	Triple nested loops
