# Time Complexity

## Space Complexity
  ### How much memory is used?

## Time Complexity
  ### How many primitive operations are executed?

  ## ... with respect to input size
  ## ... and assuming worst case scenarios

## Expect that the more data we have, the longer it will take to figure out the min and max required for the range

## However, as our dataset grows, the cost can grow really fast or slow!
