# Native Methods & JS Exressions
## What are some simple, native JS  methods/expressions/operations?

## For...in  // linear
code:
# Pop()  | Push()
  const arr = [1,2,3]
  arr.pop() //=> [1,2]
  arr[0] // O(1)
  const obj = {a: 1}  // saving is constant
  obj.a // -> 1
Complexity: O(1) => constant
Always taking the last one

# ForEach | Map => passing a callback() they are just loops. So with callback they are other factors involved

# What about 1 + n?
O(1) linear


# Shift() || Unshift()
Complexity: O(n) => linear


# What is reduce? takes a callback, and depends on the callback. Because it's a loop, so it's linear, but the callback might not be!

# Sort is n*log(n)
