1. The process:
  Look at the file structure.
  Get a sense for the vocabulary.
  Keep a note of unfamiliar concepts that you'll need to research later.
  Do a quick read-through without diving into concepts from #3.
  Test one feature with the debugger.
  Document and add comments to confusing areas.
  Research items in #3 only if required.
  Repeat.

2. Next level

  Replicate parts of the app by hand (in the console).
  Make small changes and see what happens.
  Add a new feature.

3. Unfamiliar concepts
